[16:57:28]<Cydori> I usually choco up, so I go out mines and cross into North.
[16:57:33]<Yosari> But mines to choco.
[16:57:33]<Hawkeeye> market and mines out to south gusta
[16:57:55]<Cydori> Then the peninsula in the upper right corner.
[16:58:17]<Cydori> My god, am I giving directions? ;p
[16:58:37](Hawkeeye) Ô'Hmmm.Ô( hope my int macro still works well for int based infeebs, it has a lot of mab in it now <.<

[17:01:12](Demandred) hahaha ^^
[17:01:19](Beanies) hi :o don't mind me.. i'm still thinking >.> and nif wait for me at p.mines :< i always get lost
[17:01:26](Hawkeeye) well see if i can still navigate this place <.<

[17:01:44](Beanies) really we may be giving this fight too much credit now.. but eh.. we'll see.. i know how it was at 75 so :/a
[17:01:49]–Ruroni examines you.
[17:02:05](Demandred) Better to be overprepared... and if we are, I'll run back and grab orbs
[17:02:14](Cydori) Sprint shoes + fast pants = awesome!
[17:02:29](Hawkeeye) did you use the shoes? or the kupower? 
[17:02:36](Cydori) Kupower.
[17:02:54](Cydori) I just refer to both as sprint shoes. ^^;
[17:03:08](Seyl) okay, just to go over this in general
[17:04:10](Seyl) Cydori and Kis are going to tp while it's out of it's shell
[17:04:32](Cydori) By TP you mean hit it or Ô'MeditateÔ(?
[17:04:42](Beanies) both/whichever o.o
[17:04:51](Beanies) when it's out of it's shell you guys get tp
[17:05:04](Beanies) we'll be resting mp and waiting for timers to tool
[17:05:06](Beanies) cool*
[17:05:08](Cydori) Mainly I just need to know when I should be hitting and when i should not be.
[17:05:24](Hawkeeye) i saw someone~
[17:05:27](Seyl) once they have 100tp, the blms are going to do a timed nuke to make it go into it's shell
[17:05:42](Beanies) i'm not sure there's really a "don't hit" time, but more like when it's in the shell you might only hit for 0 and no 
[17:05:45](Beanies) tp :x
[17:06:13](Hawkeeye) how does a whatever level these are land Ô'PoisonÔ( on me?
[17:06:15](Cydori) Ah, so I can't actually hurt things by hitting while it's in the shel.
[17:06:23](Beanies) right
[17:06:30](Beanies) you just prolly won't be able to tp build
[17:06:32](Seyl) once it goes in it's shell, they'll skillchain for the mages to burst on
[17:06:33](Cydori) zoning
[17:06:51](Kismar) the same way level 5 mandies can sleepga a group of level 90's XD
[17:06:51](Seyl) Drax and Nubith will try to keep requiem on while it's in it's shell, Hawk and I will try to keep it silenced
[17:06:55]Cydori waves.
[17:07:41](Beanies) otherwise it's like genbu without the en-water o.o turtle stomp, head butt.. whatever it's called
[17:07:52](Beanies) and tortoise song to frustrate nubs and drax :<
[17:07:56](Seyl) getting lost while typing XD
[17:08:01](Draxyle) woo o,o
[17:08:04](Cydori) Testing macro:
[17:08:06](Cydori) TP = 0% Ô'Ready to start Skillchain!Ô( <scall14>
[17:08:07](Beanies) sorry :<
[17:08:08](Nubith) Ô'/cheerÔ(
[17:08:14](Cydori) Is the call annoying?
[17:08:28](Beanies) i have sound off <.< gonna turn on the baseball game for noise
[17:08:41](Nubith) that one isn't taht annoying
[17:08:50](Cydori) Oh, and the other important question: what WS?
[17:08:51](Beanies) it can also do hardened shell
[17:08:56](Seyl) SC should be Ô'Shark BiteÔ( <=> Ô'Wheeling ThrustÔ( for light I think 
[17:08:57](Beanies) wheeling thrust for you
[17:09:20](Beanies) i'll also note that in a pinch sharkbite <=> atonement should be light too
[17:09:24](Seyl) and Ô'Shark BiteÔ( <=> Ô'AtonementÔ( should be light too (going by what Beanie's telling me ^^)
[17:09:35](Nubith) any palce we should try not to stand?  front?  back?
[17:09:37](Beanies) if resh happens to fall on tp he doesn't need for Ô'ChivalryÔ( or something >_>;
[17:09:44](Beanies) nah
[17:09:48](Cydori) I... may mess up occasionally, and I apologize in advance.
[17:09:52](Beanies) but run if it chases you o.o
[17:09:58](Cydori) Having not played in a month, my timing may be off slightly.
[17:10:23]Hawkeeye starts casting Stoneskin on Hawkeeye.
[17:10:26](Kismar) you can go first then cy, cant screw that up :)
[17:10:27](Seyl) if the SC/MB isn't enough to push the turtle out of it's shell, mages need to nuke it out
[17:10:31]Hawkeeye casts Stoneskin.
[17:10:31]Hawkeeye gains the effect of Stoneskin.

[17:10:47]Hawkeeye gains the effect of Refresh.
[17:10:51](Cydori) That's true.
[17:10:51](Seyl) but be ready to interrupt your cast if it pops out, so we don't prematurely make it hide again
[17:11:04](Demandred)  Will try.
[17:11:06](Kismar) then i can TA all the damage and MB damage onto resh, bwah ha ha ha ha
[17:11:14](Cydori) You want a /pchat line in my WS macro?
[17:11:44]Demandred uses an angelwing.
[17:11:53](Seyl) then we do it all over again
[17:12:02](Seyl) is there anything anyone can think of that I'm missing?
[17:12:09](Yosari) cookies o-o
[17:12:19](Beanies) if you have a problem mid fight or need more echo or something squeak o.o
[17:12:21](Kismar) i ate a moonpie
[17:12:24](Demandred) eat food, and remember to have hmp stuff, since we aren't in Abyssea
[17:12:31](Demandred) mmmm... moonpie
[17:12:32](Seyl) yes, I brought extra echos
[17:12:45](Kismar) oh right, food, what a crazy concept
[17:12:46](Beanies) yeah :o when the head it out, mages on your knees D: if you want i'll say it like fang
[17:12:58](Yosari) >.>
[17:13:03](Klaital) I should be hitting 150+ int now with food, so I'll try to keep up an ele dot set
[17:13:03](Cydori) Back under your rock!
[17:13:11](Beanies) that was easily the best part of ffxiii :<
[17:13:16](Seyl) yea, make sure you have enough mp for 2 spells before you cast to get it's head back in
[17:13:19]Demandred kneels respectfully.
[17:13:45](Seyl) whatever the timed one your casting is, and the MB spell
[17:14:27](Hawkeeye) want bio III on it or dia?
[17:14:27](Cydori) Quick afk.
[17:15:06](Seyl) get your afks in ^^ 
[17:15:42](Seyl) who wants to declare the time for the synced casts when it's heads out
[17:15:42](Demandred) Kis: did you mean to be THF/BLM?

[17:15:59]Kismar starts casting Warp on Kismar.
[17:15:59]Search result: 12 people found in all known areas.
[17:16:01](Beanies) good catch :o
[17:16:07]Kismar casts Warp.
[17:16:07]Kismar vanishes.
[17:16:19](Demandred) The perk of non-anonymity ^^; Wish I'd checked earlier though
[17:16:33](Cydori) Hey, you can warp, at least.
[17:17:28](Hawkeeye) too bad nexus cape wont bring you back to zoneline here.
[17:17:30](Seyl) and do all the blms have the thunder V? and there's no thunaja yet is there? or will you be using a different spell?
[17:17:41](Demandred) Hawk: yeah, I was just checking that
[17:17:41](Beanies) no thunder v yet i don't think?
[17:17:43](Seyl) or is TV not out yet?
[17:17:48](Hawkeeye) nope, not tV
[17:18:00](Seyl) <- my blms at 78 and blissfully ignorant
[17:18:03](Hawkeeye) blizz is the highest and also the best spell on this guy iirc
[17:18:12](Beanies) iv or gaIII is the biggest thunders i have (unless you want burst, but i'm not sure i want to be that clever D: )
[17:18:41](Seyl) gaIII do more then iv still?
[17:18:41](Yosari) Turtles hate ice o-o
[17:18:49]Izykinder panics!
[17:18:52](Yosari) They freeze their shells off.
[17:18:52]Izykinder looks at the Burning Circle and panics!
[17:18:57](Beanies) but if we're making light chain then blizzard isn't the burst iirc
[17:19:01](Demandred) Yeah, I was thinking Blizz may be our saving grace... but thunder is good if we work on lightningsday
[17:19:03](Kismar) now, what would be funny is if i still beat beanie and wrex XD
[17:19:04](Yosari) No, it's thunder >>
[17:19:14](Yosari) blizzard is for darkness.
[17:19:16](Demandred) yeah, sorry - blizz is dark chain only, yeah ^^;
[17:19:17](Wrex) yes, thunder o-o
[17:19:18](Beanies) yeah
[17:19:31](Beanies) so fire, wind, or thunder are our choices
[17:19:40](Yosari) banish 83
[17:19:44](Beanies) fire v is my current biggest nuke, but it's lightning day so >:3
[17:20:01](Wrex) poser king baron turns into a turtle.  Tellah's Lit 4 works pretty well.
[17:20:09](Beanies) hahaha
[17:20:12](Demandred) fire 5 is freakishly expensive still :x

[17:20:32]Demandred high-fives Nif.
[17:20:46](Seyl) and for SC, how much warning do you need before SC goes off to get the casting right do you think?
[17:21:14](Demandred) I am willing to go buy the spell Fire V... otherwise, I am planning on Blizz 5
[17:21:24](Beanies) iirc iv timing you cast during wheeling thrust
[17:21:41](Cydori) You want I should add in a /p line when I WS?
[17:21:44](Klaital) I'd been expecting to bliz5 and thunder4, personally. I'll need to go buy Fire spells if we're doing that
[17:21:46](Demandred) hmm... so we'd need to know before the chain for 5 likely?
[17:22:05](Beanies) if you blizz 5 it won't be burst (just pointing it out)

[18:11:01](Yosari) yeah, when you get to 100%, you need to stop damage altogether.
[18:11:07](Yosari) and then nookage
[18:11:12](Kismar) the slightest thing will put it back in, which is why you cancel nukes, and stop meleeing
[18:11:21](Kismar) then do a timed nuke
[18:11:36](Kismar) so those of you with fast cast need to be careful ^^b
[18:12:16](Klaital) the problem is that all of us have varying degrees of fast casting
[18:12:17](Hawkeeye) shouldn't the melees keep meleeing ot have TP for when we put it back in the shell?
[18:12:25](Demandred) I think that is most of us ^^;;;; I case before 45% ^^;
[18:12:35](Kismar) yeah, once we're at 100% we stop meleeing
[18:12:36](Cydori) We break off once we have 100%.
[18:12:44](Hawkeeye) ok, just making sure :)
[18:13:05](Hawkeeye) i seemd to have missed what yosa said... I'm blind.
[18:13:10](Seyl) can Cydori/Resh do dark or distortion?
[18:13:28](Neresh) I'm not sure what I can do SC wise.
[18:13:38](Neresh) but if need be, I can switch stuff around to get TP quicker.
[18:13:49](Kismar) Ô'Vorpal ThrustÔ( -> Ô'Swift BladeÔ( will do distortion
[18:13:51](Beanies) um..
[18:13:53](Hawkeeye) you can do darkness with Ô'Swift BladeÔ(
[18:14:05](Hawkeeye) but cyd can't open it with Ô'PolearmÔ(
[18:14:16](Neresh) Ô'Swift BladeÔ(, useful?  I believe that when I see it...
[18:14:17](Kismar) best they can do is Ô'DistortionÔ(
[18:14:18](Hawkeeye) unless it's one of the new WSs
[18:14:24](Klaital) Ô'Swift BladeÔ( doesn't chain with Ô'EviscerationÔ(, sadly
[18:17:15](Seyl) Cyd, can you drop and get tharpy
[18:17:17]Tharpy waves.
[18:17:22](Cydori) Righto.
[18:17:22]Seyl waves to Tharpy.
[18:17:28](Wrex) wrong button for menus >_>
[18:17:32](Wrex) But I'll live
[18:17:51]Tharpy cheers Cydori on!
[18:17:51](Kismar) you might, but will we live too? ;)
[18:18:00](Demandred) Indeed :D
[18:18:05](Wrex) maybe >_>
[18:18:15](Tharpy) af3 head/hands and another aby piece..umm
[18:18:26](Tharpy) timarli jawshan
[18:18:32](Cydori) I'm not sure I've seen that body piece before.
[18:19:15](Tharpy) i hadn't either until it dropped from something :<
[18:19:18](Beanies) tharp, for the fight it's important to get tp as fast as you can, but once you have 100% turn around
[18:19:35](Wrex) I have assigned these things to my memory when I'm in the game, but when I try to remember which button is which
[18:19:43](Wrex) in the configuration thingy, I fail =(
[18:19:44](Tharpy) Ô'EviscerationÔ( > Ô'Cross ReaperÔ( = darkness iirc
[18:19:55](Tharpy) someone help..is that right?
[18:20:01](Beanies) yes
[18:20:05](Cydori) Okay, with whom am I SC'ing, and what WS do I use?
[18:20:16](Beanies) though i think the other way around might be better
[18:20:20](Beanies) with tharp open and kis close?
[18:20:33](Kismar) yeah
[18:20:40](Tharpy) i was going to ask..isn't that one interchangable ...  works for me
[18:20:41](Kismar) we can flip it, Ô'Cross ReaperÔ( -> Ô'EviscerationÔ(
[18:20:44](Demandred) so we have two sets of SCs?
[18:20:58](Beanies) hopefully? depends on resh's tp gain
[18:20:59](Demandred) Cydori/Neresh and Kismar/Tharpy?
[18:21:18](Seyl) yes. we want to rely on Kis & Tharpy for the big one, since it's darkness
[18:21:28](Beanies) please keep calling thing in /p, that's really what i'm watching
[18:21:30](Tharpy) Kismar:  TP 0%

[18:56:35]Draxyle starts casting Mage's Ballad II on Draxyle.
[18:56:45](Nubith) so is it evry time it takes damage out of the shell it has a chance to go back in?

[18:56:48](Yosari) well, um, I can't see everyone's MP >.> So calling times is hard
[18:56:59](Seyl) if all melee turn around as soon as it comes out of the shell, mages take a knee
[18:56:59]Anderoc : I'm serious
[18:57:07](Hawkeeye) I think it's a certain amout of damage will cause it to retreat into it's shell
[18:57:10]Klaital's Refresh effect wears off.
[18:57:12]Beanies : if we got eggs we wouldn't be on this side, you realize? :x
[18:57:29]Anderoc : you could have left and have one guy open a chest
[18:57:31](Seyl) one person, Yos or whomever is calling time will let say when mages are roughly 75-100%
[18:57:54](Hawkeeye) if I come again, i'll be /whm for Ô'EraseÔ(, Ô'SlowgaÔ( sucks.
[18:57:58](Seyl) then do the timed nuke, to get it in, SC to get it out, then turn around
[18:58:03](Cydori) Sometimes it will come out after a burst.  But sometimes it won't.  Is there any way to make that happen more often?
[18:58:08](Cydori) or is it sheerly arbitrary?
[18:58:16](Yosari) it only happens when it has 100% TP.
[18:58:18](Seyl) we didn't have everyone bursting
[18:58:34](Tharpy) is there a safe time i can absorb-tp?
[18:58:34](Yosari) however that happens aside from damage >.>
[18:58:36](Kismar) hmmm maybe i should take off the twilight knife then
[18:58:38](Seyl) once that happened, we lost time
[18:58:38](Hawkeeye) shell transisiton is TP based? >.> cause I can feed tp quickly
[18:58:52](Cydori) Was that our last run?
[18:58:58](Hawkeeye) I thought shell transitions were damage based.
[18:59:06](Cydori) 'cause I'm hearing a Ô'ThunderstormÔ( outside and i should probably go.
[18:59:07](Seyl) I don't have another orb on me, I'm up for trying again if everyone else is
[18:59:16](Yosari) wiki says TP, which kind of makes sense since it always does a TP move as soon as it comes out.
[18:59:18](Neresh) I'm game.
[18:59:25](Neresh) it's either this or sittin' on my ass.
[18:59:31](Neresh) ...oh wait, I already am sitting on my ass.
[18:59:45](Hawkeeye) that's odd.  I can just spam dia or bio then to feed it 10% tp if I cause damage to it <.<
[18:59:46](Beanies) i can grab another egg if people want to try
[18:59:48](Seyl) who doesn't want to go again?
[19:00:03](Tharpy) i need to afk at in 32 mins... 
[19:00:03](Cydori) Yeah, I need to go, it's starting to sound nasty.
[19:00:07](Beanies) er.. not egg.. stupid alliance.. orb
[19:00:11](Cydori) I'll log here and check back in after the storm has passed.

[19:38:00](Demandred) definitely helped for the mage team
[19:38:14]<Hawkeeye> gonna log for a second, but I'll brb
[19:38:18](Seyl) if Nubith is available (sorry Nubs) that'll give us another mage with Drax on sch or blm
[19:38:23](Seyl) er sch or rdm
[19:38:40]<Seyl> thanks for coming Hawk
[19:39:04](Seyl) I'm not sure there's a way for melee to get tp faster
[19:39:12](Seyl) without hitting it
[19:39:34](Demandred) actually the TP speed was generally fine for me
[19:39:46](Seyl) I was thinking more for it going back into it's shell
[19:39:47](Beanies) yeah, needed resting time more generally
[19:39:50](Demandred) I was riding most of my spell timers pretty narrowly, I think
[19:40:03](Seyl) from what Kis could tell, 1k damage on the part of melee and Resh made it hide
[19:40:15](Demandred) O.o yeesh
[19:40:17](Beanies) i think the timed to push it in then sc > burst > nuke like mad to get it out again worked
[19:40:26](Beanies) but best when i was near full mp to do that
[19:40:34](Demandred) /nodnod
[19:40:37](Kismar) yeah, which is why we need to cancel spells if it pops its head out
[19:40:45](Beanies) yeah :o 
[19:40:52](Beanies) we got the idea, just need practice o.ob
[19:41:02](Seyl) we got it down to half really quickly once Resh started kiting
[19:41:06](Kismar) once we got our groove on, we took out half its health in 5 minutes or so
[19:41:31](Seyl) good idea Nif, Beanie ^^
[19:41:36](Seyl) and good to know bind works so well
[19:41:44](Beanies) yes :o
[19:41:56](Seyl) 2 rdms should be able to keep it bound most the kiting phase
[19:42:15](Seyl) and silenced when it's in it's shell
[19:42:36](Seyl) it wore at bad times XD
[19:43:02](Beanies) i need to remember i have enm douse now and run up and use it when the timer is up or something <.<;
[19:43:26](Demandred) So it sounds like getting a scroll of Fire V isn't as important as I thought it was ^^;
[19:43:45](Beanies) maybe for wyrm? ;3 we've got 2 more after all
[19:43:58](Beanies) this is just the start!
[19:44:28](Beanies) (actually i don't remember what either of them are weak to.. except not arrows >_> )
[19:45:48](Demandred) wiki says...  wyrm is strong to fire and ice... weak to water and thunder
[19:45:57](Beanies) how about behemoth?
[19:46:01](Seyl) and Yos, thanks for being the timekeeper when it was needed
[19:46:07](Beanies) i really only remember running around on that one <.<;
[19:46:07](Yosari) >.>b
[19:46:27](Beanies) but water v is encouraging.. and T4
[19:46:30](Demandred) behemoth has no data... 
[19:47:03](Demandred) but the crystal is water...
[19:47:38]<Kismar> g'night everyone!
[19:47:45]<Wrex> night
[19:47:46]<Demandred> Gnight Kis
[19:47:50](Beanies) at least turtle is like.. no chance of dying except odd one shots
[19:47:56]<Hawkeeye> heyo, i'm back~
[19:47:58](Beanies) the other two can potentially plaster us >_>;
[19:48:04]<Beanies> night and wb
[19:48:07](Demandred) Sounds accurate
[19:48:10]<Demandred> wb
[19:48:31](Demandred) I'll look to get the scroll anyway, but will just note that it is.... possibly less useful than I'd like ^^
[19:48:33](Seyl) O.o why do I have a ton of snapping moles and fetishes?
[19:48:47](Demandred) Hawkeeye killing a lot of quadavs for fun
[19:48:52](Seyl) ah
[19:48:56](Neresh) I'm not touching that with a 10 foot pole.
[19:49:09](Demandred) how about with Kirin's pole?
[19:49:11](Seyl) lol
[19:49:48](Beanies) farming for fire v is still possible.. but i try to have all my spells regardless on the happenschance it might be
[19:49:54](Beanies) useful <.<
[19:50:05](Beanies) i was certainly happy i went out of my way to geist wall last night x3
[19:50:09](Seyl) Resh are you up for working on your pld pants and going to the other atma/abyssite
[19:50:11](Demandred) I usually do, but I wait for the cost to come down a little past the NPC price if I can
[19:50:31](Seyl) on thursday again? or would another day be better?
[19:50:40](Seyl) Kis and I are free on Tuesdays now
[19:50:44](Neresh) Thursday's just fine.
[19:50:54](Neresh) Tuesday works too, honestly.
[19:51:00](Seyl) hope you don't mind being on pld for it
[19:51:04](Neresh) I don't really have anything going on.  x.x;
[19:51:08](Neresh) Nope, don't mind at all.
[19:52:00](Beanies) are fire v and the -ja the only ones you and klai are missing?
[19:52:03](Seyl) if you need Fire Vs, I'm hoping to drag Yos and Tharpy out to play with an NM goblin in Grauberg for their body piece
[19:52:29](Seyl) seals after we get Resh (and hopefully them) some pants and other atma/abyssite
[19:52:44](Seyl) the NM for the Goblin pop item drops Fire V
[19:53:04](Demandred) are you referring tot eh gob NM that I have the pop for? (goblin oil)
[19:53:07](Demandred) *to the
[19:53:33](Seyl) and Kis and I plan on farming the Roc NM for +2s, the NM that drops his KI also drops it
[19:53:52](Seyl) yup, we want at least 5 people willing to get hit for the goblin
[19:54:17](Seyl) has an aoe like 1k needles that can do ~5-6k from what I read
[19:54:17](Beanies) i have a fat enough head to count as 2 o.o
[19:54:21](Demandred) Ah, I assume that will include me then ^^
[19:54:38](Demandred) My WAR has had itself knocked upside the head more than I can count
[19:55:00](Seyl) depending on how it often it does it, /smn might actually be rather useful
[19:55:12](Demandred) you mean SMN main?
[19:55:23](Seyl) nope, /smn, with carby out to eat some of the damage
[19:55:37](Demandred) WAR/SMN... that is quite a novel thought ^^;
[19:55:38](Seyl) since it'll be 5k spread out to everyone in range
[19:55:46](Demandred) I am not sure whether I can sustain that
[19:55:49](Seyl) lol, I meant mages mostly
[19:55:50](Beanies) well whm/smn might be a more realistic though :x
[19:55:51](Neresh) Droppin' for now.  Y'all Ô'Take care.Ô(  ^^
[19:55:59](Demandred) Gnight Neresh
[19:56:04](Demandred) ahhh, ok ^^
[19:56:16](Seyl) or /bst with a pet (not sure /bst can charm use call)
[19:56:22](Seyl) in abyssea I mean
[19:56:27](Wrex) gonna log here :o  I'll be on irc
[19:56:31](Seyl) night
[19:56:34](Demandred) Later Nif
[19:56:50](Demandred) I don't think you can charm in Abyssea?  But maybe I am mistaken
[19:57:04](Seyl) I've absolutely no clue :D
[19:57:06](Seyl) lol
[19:57:20](Beanies) i don't think you can charm, but would need to look at call beast
[19:57:53](Demandred) I have only seen jug pets in there, so that is what I am going based on
[19:59:28](Demandred) It will be an interesting critter to fight
[19:59:46](Seyl) it's one of the best NMs for Yos and Tharpy
[19:59:54](Seyl) Sch, drk and pup if I'm remembering right
[20:00:31](Seyl) or sch drk and blm... it's 3 jobs.. might be sch, drk, rdm... going to check, lol
[20:01:02](Seyl) sch pup and rdm 
[20:01:40](Yosari) o.o well slap me silly
[20:02:16](Seyl) if the goblin ends up being pretty easy
[20:02:38](Seyl) it'll be a good place to farm 4 sets of rdm body seals too, 3 sets of sch as well :)
[20:02:41](Demandred) If it is Emperador de Altepa, it drops MNK RDM BLU BRD body seals
[20:03:12](Demandred) and SCH PUP RDM is a nice set of seals :o
[20:03:15](Seyl) yea, that's on the list of guys to fight, it looks to be a good one for mnk depending on how the fighting actually go
[20:03:46](Seyl) I think the other mnk one is the giant that can draw everyone in then do tp moves like crazy
[20:04:17](Beanies) there are quests too.. but a lot to do already
[20:04:52](Seyl) once Resh gets used to tanking in abyssea, I plan to abuse him to get portent pants for our mages too
[20:05:07](Seyl) enhancing, enfeebling and dark magic skill +15
[20:05:16](Demandred) hehehe
[20:05:26](Yosari) how portentous o-o
[20:05:45](Demandred) :3
[20:05:46](Seyl) we can time popping Raja for blunt to make sure we have all the triggers for blue
[20:06:10](Seyl) but they're a nice pair of pants, and after we finish getting rdm gloves for all of us, we'll have +60 enfeebling 
[20:06:24](Seyl) enfeebling skill betweent he af1-3 and those pants
[20:07:02](Beanies) gonna seek since it's still kinda early here and i'm dressed for it
[20:07:10](Seyl) farming Rani for our melee will be harder
[20:07:13](Seyl) good luck ^^
[20:07:24](Demandred) Good luck Beanie ^^
[20:07:27](Yosari) :3
[20:07:39](Demandred) Seyl: definitely ^^;
[20:07:43](Beanies) sorry, but this job is so boring D: how in the hell do you manage not to fall asleep while waiting for mp :/a
[20:07:59](Demandred) In abyssea, that's not usually an issue ^^;
[20:08:05](Seyl) I think for Rani, we'll want to get everyone apocalypse then have each person brew who wants it and hope
[20:08:07](Yosari) Making smartass comments >.>
[20:08:12](Demandred) I'm going off to forage
[20:08:31](Demandred) Seyl - likely a reasonable way to go
[20:08:34](Beanies) meh.. D: <gnaws on blm unlovingly>
[20:08:38](Beanies) here's hoping
[20:08:41](Yosari) *pets the bean* :<
[20:08:42](Demandred) See you all laterish :3
[20:09:09](Yosari) dear SE: Hydra storable, plzkthx
[20:09:17](Seyl) Ô'Yes, please.Ô(
[20:09:24](Seyl) and all the crour lvl 78 gear
[20:11:54]<Seyl> Tharpy Yos, not this week most likely, but the following if you're up for it, I'd like to kill the cockatrice to get 
[20:12:02]<Seyl> get you guys blm, sch, and rdm heads
[20:12:13]<Yosari> Ooh o.o
[20:12:25]<Yosari> I do love me some fancy hats.
[20:12:28]<Seyl> and Beanie too  ^^
[20:12:42]<Hawkeeye> cock has HOORRRIIIIBBBLLLLEEE drop rate for rdm <.< at least in my experience ; ;
[20:12:51]<Seyl> the cockatrice is a mage friendly NM and really easy to kill
[20:12:57]<Seyl> I got mine from him really fast
[20:13:07]<Seyl> it's pretty random what drops
[20:13:21]<Hawkeeye> i think we finished every blm's hat before we got my 6 seals I needed from him <.<
[20:13:22]<Seyl> and if we don't finish off rdm for Yos, we can kill percy easily enough
[20:13:48]<Hawkeeye> game just hates me, I should get more used to it :P
[20:14:03]<Seyl> nah I haven't been able to finish rdm hands yet, that cockatrice liked you
[20:14:09]<Seyl> I keep seeing thf and pld there
[20:14:27]<Hawkeeye> the hands one did, that's true
[20:14:41](Yosari) Gonna disband and run around. See y'all >.>/
[20:15:23]<Seyl> I also want to go after the sch accessory in.. Konschtat I think
[20:15:50]<Neresh> OK folks, I'm out for the night.  Might be on IRC a little while longer though.  z.zb
[20:15:52]<Seyl> enhances sublimation, gives another mp

[21:44:48]<Merton> How'd that turtle thing go?
[21:45:01]<Beanies> we stalemated 3 times, *but* we learned a lot
[21:45:28]<Merton> Well that's a positive.
[21:45:34]<Beanies> wasn't a win, but we know how to win now
[21:46:43]<Beanies> well we took the 3rd buffalo down to 50% health in 5 minutes.. unfortunately we only had 5 minute left
[21:46:46]<Beanies> when it all clicked
[21:46:51]<Beanies> but at least we have method now
[21:47:08]<Merton> Next time!
[21:47:31]<Beanies> i have 1000ks that says we'll keep trying
[21:47:36]<Beanies> as long as i can beg >_>
[03:51:00]Klaital's Signet effect wears off.
[16:41:35]<Hydrabo> i am both confused and intriguiged by kis's blm/sam >_>a
[16:42:02]<Neresh> BLM/SAM?  o.o;
[16:42:05]<Seyl> lol
[16:42:37]<Seyl> I logged him in to check the weather
[16:43:01]<Hydrabo> poor kisbot
[16:43:38]<Hydrabo> got blm90 z.zv
[16:43:50]<Seyl> Ô'Congratulations!Ô(

[16:45:42]<Hydrabo> <3 spring
[16:46:20]<Hydrabo> there.. rest of blm scrolls bought >_>a
[16:46:57]<Seyl> this game hates me...
[16:46:59]<Hydrabo> i've also concluded fire v is *amazing* when being chased by eles in ul-range >_>;
[16:47:05]<Seyl> 1 more kill wind weather disappears
[16:47:10]<Hydrabo> :/
[16:47:34]<Neresh> Little taru, this game hates all of us.
[16:47:59]<Seyl> this has happened a lot with these daggers
[16:50:14]<Seyl> here's hoping it'll be windy in Ô'Aht UrhganÔ(
[16:52:38]<Beanies> well, that could've been worse.. 400k in scrolls.. but i remember utsu:ni being over 2mil =.=
[16:55:54]<Seyl> wind weather... gotta hurry
[16:56:00]<Beanies> run run :o
[16:57:03]<Seyl> oh, I made a post with everything
[16:57:30]<Seyl> we learned about fighting the turtle
[16:57:38]<Beanies> okay :o
[16:57:46]<Beanies> i'm thinking i'll blm/rdm this next time
[16:57:59]<Beanies> just in case i get caught flat footed again of stuck in shell w/o MP
[16:58:03]<Beanies> convert and keep nuking >_>;
[16:58:18]<Seyl> I didn't want to forget and waste an orb
[16:58:25]<Beanies> yeah :
[16:58:29]<Beanies> er :o
[16:59:58]<Seyl> yay finished it
[17:00:04]<Beanies> grats :>
[17:00:51]<Seyl> actually, I was thinking /rdm would probably help a decent amount for blms
[17:01:22]<Beanies> yeah.. i think it's a good adjustment.. i'll bring a RR earring so i can get up if it headbutts me again
[17:01:24]<Seyl> 2-3 converts
[17:01:34]<Beanies> but i'd also forgotten how forgiving the SC window is
[17:01:43]<Beanies> so i think i'll be able to hit it even with fast cast
[17:01:57]<Seyl> it's a lot of mp gotten back
[17:02:22]<Beanies> yeah D: that's and wanting another blizz to throw were the biggest bottlenecks i noticed in nuking
[17:02:34]<Beanies> fixed the blizz problem, can fix the mp problem >.>v
[17:07:16]<Seyl> 200 rabbits, 250 puks and 300 plantoids and I'm done with this dagger XD
[17:10:56]<Neresh> Hmm...I wonder if the PC can handle converting/streaming and FFXI...
[17:12:19]<Neresh> damn...this is impressive.
[17:13:24]<Neresh> Seyl, would you like to join us in abyssia?
[17:13:43]<Seyl> I think I'm going to work on my dagger a bit more, but I might join you later
[17:13:46]<Tharpy> evening all :)
[17:13:57]<Beanies> o.ob
[17:14:18]<Neresh> A'righty.

[17:16:27]<Seyl> what are you watching?
[17:16:39]<Neresh> Ghost the Shell:  Stand Alone Complex, 2nd GIG.
[17:16:44]<Seyl> ah
[17:16:52]<Beanies> <3
[17:16:58]<Beanies> i love gits
[17:17:03]<Neresh> I can stream it to my iPad now (and iPhone) while I play FFXI.
[17:17:19]<Yosari> she also likes ghost in the shell
[17:17:20]<Neresh> That wasn't the original purpose of the streaming software, but it's cool to know it'll do it.
[17:17:22]<Yosari> <.<
[17:17:37]<Beanies> smartass >_>
[17:18:13]<Yosari> :3
[17:18:14]<Beanies> behave or i'll start baseball fangirling on you :|
[17:18:22]<Yosari> D: I'll be good
[17:18:33]<Beanies> oh, yosa <_<
[17:18:40]<Tharpy> haha
[17:18:52]<Beanies> i was telling mom about dana's gun lessons lately (since mom has met dana and knows she's a real person)
[17:19:02]<Beanies> and i mention that you hunt phesants
[17:19:11]<Beanies> and mom wanted me to tell you she used to raise phesants >_>
[17:19:17]<Neresh> Ooh, my dad does that.
[17:19:17]<Yosari> I don't hunt pheasants. o.oa
[17:19:20]<Beanies> (for the tail feathers to make flylures)
[17:19:28]<Yosari> I have hunted doves, though >.>a
[17:19:31]<Beanies> oh <_< i knew it was some bird.. nevermind then
[17:19:36]<Beanies> you can't eat a dove :|
[17:19:51]<Beanies> i assumed you gave them a fighting chance :|
[17:19:54]<Tharpy> yeah you can....they're bit sized
[17:19:56]<Yosari> There is some meat on a dove (I don't really like them). 
[17:19:57]<Tharpy> *bite
[17:20:08]<Neresh> Yes, you can eat dove and quail.
[17:20:41]<Beanies> dove is a soap and y'all suck :|
[17:21:16]<Tharpy> you should visit the midwest/south more... everything is nearly edible
[17:21:42]<Beanies> that would be why i haven't visited more than i have <_<;
[17:22:05]<Tharpy> ;-;
[17:22:37]<Neresh> OK, how many of you kids want to do something?
[17:22:50]<Beanies> /
[17:22:55]<Tharpy> /
[17:23:26]<Tharpy> we could fov something too if we don't have peeps... need to level sam for when blm's done :<
[17:23:44]<Neresh> Well thus far, it's just the three of us.
[17:23:50]<Yosari> as there was a zone, I would like to express my interest in going in an extremely verbose manner.
[17:24:04]<Neresh> And then there was 4.
[17:24:18]<Tharpy> and then we can kidnap the obligatory taru :<
[17:24:28]<Tharpy> where is the taru?
[17:24:38]<Beanies> i dunno o.o irc
[17:25:49]<Neresh> He was in a tornado watch earlier.
[17:26:01]<Neresh> He seemed worried, but around here that's just a normal state of being.  x.x;
[17:26:02]<Tharpy> aww
[17:26:11]<Beanies> he's logging in
[17:27:16]<Wrex> hihi o.ov

[17:33:11]<Wrex> okay, but lemme switch video mode o.ob

[17:38:21]<Wrex> and rejiggering my gamepad again >_>
[17:41:15]<Neresh> Interesting...I thought she quit.  Aceneca

[17:41:31]Nimbex>> In for seals and stuff tonight?
[17:44:48]>>Nimbex : I can be. Dem is studying tonight, as her exam is this friday
[17:47:34]Nimbex>> k, so we job shuffle a bit, I guess.
[17:48:03]<Tharpy> xp in spider country
[17:48:06]<Neresh> Yosa, we're heading back to the spiders.
[17:48:12]<Yosari> Okay
[17:50:02]Nimbex>> Should I form/invite you, or are you still in the middle of tuff?
[17:51:49]>>Nimbex : hah, I forgot to log out last night >.> hence the lingering party 
[17:52:04]>>Nimbex : I can ship out anytime, just let me know what job you want
[17:52:12]Nimbex invites you to his party.
[17:52:37](Nimbex) heya
[17:52:44](Drydin) Ô'Hello!Ô(
[17:52:47](Nimbex) I figure as long as we're on, it makes more sense to discuss before Morlock appears.
[17:52:54](Nimbex) Klai, what's your take on WHMing?
[17:53:09](Klaital) I can do it, if needed
[17:53:18](Nimbex) If there's no Dem, I know klai/nim/kir all have it, but I'd rather do things we're best at or happiest with.
[17:53:45](Nimbex) And I am keen on NIN, personally, if I can.
[17:53:52](Klaital) works for me
[17:54:34]Moogle : Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with faint lightning energy, kupo!
[17:54:34]Your Mog Locker lease is valid until 2011/5/12 17:55:51, kupo.
[17:54:35]Moogle : çChaaange...job! Kupopopooo!
[17:54:41](Nimbex) NIN SAM DRK   WHM BLM we could do
[17:54:47]Moogle : çI'll look after your items, kupo!
[17:54:49](Nimbex) nim mor dry  klai kir
[17:54:50](Nimbex) for example
[17:54:58]yYou throw away a Themis orb.
[17:55:00]Moogle : Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with faint lightning energy, kupo!
[17:55:00]Your Mog Locker lease is valid until 2011/5/12 17:55:51, kupo.
[17:55:01]Moogle : çI'll look after your items, kupo!
[17:55:40]Moogle : çI'll look after your items, kupo!
[17:55:42](Nimbex) I guess, Klai, I don't know which jobs you're favoring/preferring/best geared with, these days.
[17:55:56](Nimbex) So if we're set with that for tonight, cool.  But if you have some preferences I should know about...
[17:56:05](Nimbex) I want to keep everyone happy and stuff.
[17:56:42](Nimbex) brb feeding cats
[17:57:03](Klaital) probably best geared is NIN and PLD, then BLM, then eventually RNG, then WHM
[17:57:50](Klaital) annoyingly, I think that with amtas on, my NIN out-DDs my RNG
[17:58:20]Moogle : çI'll look after your items, kupo!
[17:58:41]Moogle : çI'll look after your items, kupo!
[17:59:46]Moogle : Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with faint lightning energy, kupo!
[17:59:46]Your Mog Locker lease is valid until 2011/5/12 17:55:51, kupo.
[18:01:30](Nimbex) hmm, would it make more sense for me to come WHM and you to come [tank]?
[18:01:46](Klaital) nah, I'm already geared
[18:02:24](Nimbex) Good enough.
[18:02:33](Nimbex) Well, next time, I can swap roles around or something!
[18:02:44](Klaital) no sweat
[18:03:04](Klaital) I'm just used to being NIN for abyssea, as it works best when duoing with Dem
[18:03:16](Nimbex) And then Dry needs to only -sometimes- take hate from me.  :D
[18:03:34](Nimbex) ya, me+kir have done some good NIN+WHM duoing here and there.
[18:03:44](Nimbex) Speaking of which, you should take her rarab-hunting, I think?
[18:03:53](Klaital) I should?
[18:03:56](Nimbex) Though I'm happy to do that with a group of 5-6 some time, too, for way more procs.
[18:04:05](Nimbex) I seem to recall that she still needs an orison cape.
[18:04:13](Klaital) oh, right
[18:04:27](Nimbex) Even though I am traumatized at the thought of rarab killing, of course.
[18:04:33](Klaital) of course
[18:04:48](Klaital) I don't really whm enough to care these days >.>; I'm mostly just geared as WHM75
[18:04:52](Nimbex) hmm, down to 2 mithkabobs
[18:05:38](Nimbex) any advice on food these days?  Probably something DDish, I'd think, so maybe just more kabobs?
[18:05:46](Nimbex) eva food is pretty lame, after all
[18:06:26]Morlock>> hey
[18:06:30]>>Morlock : howdy
[18:06:34](Klaital) sadly, yeah
[18:06:39](Klaital) I just use mithkabobs too
[18:06:41](Nimbex) heya
[18:06:52](Morlock) howdy
[18:06:56](Nimbex) ok, so, we discussed a bit.
[18:07:07](Nimbex) klai-WHM kir-BLM  nim-nin  dry-drk  mor-sam
[18:07:12](Nimbex) dem-student
[18:07:24](Morlock) ok
[18:07:37](Nimbex) I think Kir has some idea of what might be a good thing or two to kill, and place to go.
[18:07:43](Nimbex) She'll be along shortly, I think.
[18:07:43](Morlock) ok
[18:08:02](Morlock) ... I learned something very sad today about Battlestar Galatica
[18:08:28](Morlock) if the original series had actually had 2 seasons, Isaac Asamov would have consulted on the writing for season 2

[22:19:27]<Beanies> :< 
[22:19:42]<Beanies> a reasonable question to ask, but a hard time to ask it >.o;
[22:19:48]<Seyl> it's standard, but still

[22:21:48]<Seyl> mostly for money issues
[22:21:56]<Beanies> yeah, exactly
[22:22:12]<Seyl> if they didn't ask, and they used some major means to bring your pet back and you weren't willing to pay for it..
[22:23:06]<Seyl> if tomorrow takes 4 hours or more with Aerith, I'm going to skip the rest of work
[22:23:32]<Seyl> I want to stay home with her for a good 30-60 minutes anyways, to make sure she's calmed down

[22:25:24]<Seyl> couple of days before bringing him in, I can't remember exactly what it was, but I think his pancreas
[22:25:50]<Beanies> x.x
[22:25:52]<Seyl> they ended up keeping him at least 24 hours, and was on medications for 2 weeks
[22:26:07]<Seyl> might have been more, it's been a year
[22:26:12]<Seyl> but he didn't recover well from it

[22:27:41]<Seyl> but I think he's closer to 17.... (they had him before I met Kis for at least 3 years...)
[22:27:57]<Seyl> so he's at least 14
[22:28:16]<Seyl> but either way it wasn't fun
[22:28:58]<Seyl> my cats are docile compared to him too, poor Aerith just looked at me asking why I was letting them take her again

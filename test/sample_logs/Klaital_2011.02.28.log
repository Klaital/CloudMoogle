[18:28:38](Morlock) heya folks!

[18:28:47](Kireila) i feel like i'm being camped
[18:29:00](Morlock) Kireila, you are!
[18:29:17](Morlock) looks like Drydin is going to off in Ô'Dynamis - BastokÔ( 
[18:29:28](Nimbex) yah, mon/thu dynamis now, I guess, and he neeeeeeeeds dynamis
[18:29:31](Kireila) drydin is actually getting useful shit done
[18:30:32](Nimbex) klai, do you have anything in particular in mind as "good to kill" for this crowd?
[18:30:50](Klaital) not offhand 
[18:31:08]<Seyl> I like the fire guys uncle
[18:31:22](Nimbex) 'cuz I'm not massively prepared with ideas, myself.  Because I am noob.
[18:31:22]<Alake> yeah, iroh's cool
[18:31:25]<Yosari> Everyone loves Iroh.
[18:31:34](Morlock) I'm all about killing more Whiro
[18:31:52](Morlock) mostly because I was robbed the last time we tried that
[18:31:57]<Beanies> iroh's all sorts of cool >_>v especially in season 3
[18:32:00](Nimbex) I don't mind trying.
[18:32:05](Klaital) works for me
[18:32:27](Morlock) I am, incidentally, not intending to be here next Monday ... unless something bizarre happens
[18:32:35](Kireila) me neither
[18:32:40](Kireila) i'll be sleeping
[18:32:55](Morlock) I will be awake ... but it is likely to be about 10:00 AM
[18:33:10](Nimbex) I guess Ineed to place a scotch order by then.
[18:33:28](Nimbex) So, appropriate jobs for whiro?  I usually have been WHMing for abyssea, but can certainly NIN if needed]
[18:33:37](Morlock) you should email me by this time next week, since that will be about the time I will be shopping for it
[18:33:40](Nimbex) I even have nin katanas with some evasion of note now
[18:33:43](Nimbex) k
[18:33:53](Klaital) I can NIN, BLM, RNG or THF8
[18:34:02](Nimbex) Though still lv75, I'm pretty close to wrapping up.  I have had much good help from Drydin and Kireila and others!  \
[18:34:18](Kireila) jps*
[18:34:33](Nimbex) whee, a hagun
[18:34:39](Klaital) I finally finished out my eva Sekka +2 yesterday, thanks to Dem's pestering
[18:34:44](Nimbex) nice
[18:34:50](Nimbex) I'm on colibri now
[18:35:03](Klaital) that's where I was yesterday morning
[18:35:14](Morlock) so, Whiro then?
[18:35:17](Nimbex) So what do we need for whiro?  
[18:35:22](Nimbex) I don't think I've ever fought it.
[18:35:29](Morlock) last time WHM WHM SAM was not the best
[18:35:43](Morlock) ... Nimbex, it was that bastard who we lost hate on at like 1% health
[18:35:55](Nimbex) oh, eft?
[18:36:00](Kireila) the bastard you lost hate on and someone stole it*
[18:36:02](Klaital) yeah
[18:36:07](Nimbex) Guyford x.x
[18:36:24](Kireila) that guy is a major dickstore
[18:36:33](Kireila) ryu sure told him off :<

[18:37:02](Nimbex) and we want to make sure we can proc on it?
[18:37:05](Nimbex) it's been a while.
[18:37:20](Kireila) well, i've never fought the thing because I only did cock for whm hat
[18:37:42](Nimbex) so SAM BRD BLM WHM probably gives us the most yellow proc options?
[18:37:57](Kireila) i'd prefer blm

[18:40:27](Kireila) nimbex probably needs
[18:40:33](Kireila) but other than that, I don't think so
[18:40:36](Morlock) WHM head?
[18:40:41](Kireila) yes
[18:40:43]You cannot use that command inside a Rent-a-Room.

[18:40:57]<Seyl> I'd rather not have another mess in my laundry room
[18:41:00](Nimbex) I like WHM and NIN stuff.  I want 5/5 for both, and currently only have nin hands.
[18:41:01](Morlock) I would at least like to make sure we're covering 2 people each week

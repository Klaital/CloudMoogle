[21:01:44](Kireila) I spent so much gil trying to make umbra cape, and now I need gil for ninjaz
[21:01:47](Kireila) ffs
[21:01:50](Kireila) I am so poor 
[21:02:31](Kireila) also, if there are any items in particular that you're interested in, we could spam those nms, too
[21:02:41](Kireila) like loki's or whatevers
[21:02:44](Klaital) haha, can't wear the Orison Mitts +1 yet -.-;
[21:02:47](Nimbex) nin earring is crap... not sure if any other accessories is worthwhile
[21:02:51](Kireila) and probably pick up some much needed catmas
[21:03:02](Nimbex) ha, didn't realize you were only 84
[21:03:05](Kireila) aw!
[21:03:15](Kireila) that's ok, I can't wear dnc hands!
[21:03:20](Nimbex) no biggie, we both finished, though, and you can get that easily any time
[21:03:21]ÐSalviano examines you.
[21:03:32](Klaital) it'd be 90 by now, but every xp party I joined was filled with ï'Leechï(es
[21:03:37](Klaital) which ticked me off
[21:03:46](Kireila) bah
[21:03:59]Hydrabo pokes Klaital.
[21:04:01](Kireila) so glad I am gone with leveling for now, but I'd like some more cruor I guess

[21:04:28](Klaital) both my THF and WHM are stuck <90 because I hate people >.>;
[21:04:40](Nimbex) hah
[21:04:41](Kireila) people suck!
[21:04:47](Klaital) indeed
[21:05:56](Kireila) also! if there's any atma you want from doing those dom ops, we could do those, too
[21:06:22](Kireila) though those are kind of sort of easy
[21:08:02](Klaital) haven't really looked into any more lately
[21:08:17](Klaital) Dem says thanks for the seals!
[21:08:23](Kireila) also, we don't really need to do this every week, honestly
[21:08:25](Nimbex) I would like to get a few more atma, but mostly abyssite of HP/MP
[21:08:34](Klaital) I am forcing her to eat ice cream now
[21:08:35](Nimbex) I don't mind trying to, but I won't be upset to miss, either.
[21:08:40](Kireila) !!
[21:08:43](Kireila) she needs an ice cream break!
[21:08:49](Klaital) yes, exactly!
[21:08:51](Nimbex) snoll gelato
[21:08:57](Kireila) :9
[21:09:08](Kireila) aw man, now you make me want to eat my ice creams in the freezer
[21:09:39](Nimbex) I already brushed my teeth, so no ZESTY LEMON for me.
[21:09:40](Kireila) i has bryer's vanilla and hagen daazs mango
[21:09:43](Klaital) I think the only merit abyssite I'm missing is the one that requires level 6 fame in ï'La Theine Plateauï( 
[21:09:45](Nimbex) anyway, I am full of Zs, I should sleep!
[21:09:55](Klaital) or wherever it was -.-
[21:10:01](Klaital) I should go sleep too
[21:10:02](Kireila) ugh, yeah, me too, I need to get fame in all of those areas
[21:10:06](Nimbex) and seals are most key to me, but HP/MP abyssites are good.......
[21:10:08](Klaital) g'night!
[21:10:15](Nimbex) but yes sleeep
[21:10:17](Kireila) yeah, don't let dem stay up too late!
[21:10:20](Nimbex) ï'Good night!ï(
